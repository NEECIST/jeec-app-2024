      <li>To earn points for activities that are not performed in the app, you must use your QR Code.</li>
      <li>For the Job Fair activity, you must present the QR Code to the people in the booth. For other activities, you present it to the JEEC members stationed at that activity.</li>
      <li>Points are divided into daily points and total points. Daily points are the points gained in the present day. Total points are all the points gained throughout the week, including the daily points.</li>
      <li>You can also create a squad to earn squad points. Squad points are only earned by their members while they are in the squad. If a member of the squad leaves it or gets banned, all points earned by that member are deleted from the squad. Squads can have up to 4 members.</li>
    </ol>
